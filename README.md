# ATBS Rename Dates
---
This program finds American dates(mm-dd-yyyy) in the titles of .txt files and changes them to European dates (dd-mm-yyyy)

A very useful program that sets the foundation for finding certain files and being able to rename them quickly.

The random files are to show how the program works once you uncomment the last line. (The programs will be permantly changed be careful when using this program)
